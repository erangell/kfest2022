# kfest2022
Continuation of my 35 year slackfest

DiskImages directory has Annunciator 2 MIDI 2021 Update and Edasm assembler environment used to build it.
This system was demonstrated in a Kansasfest 2018 lightning talk and described in Paleotronic magazine.
Requires Apple 2e or 2GS with 128K and 80 columns.  Midi OUT cable is connected to Annunciator #2 of the game socket.

2021 update allows you to use the D key to mute drum track on MIDI channel 9.
(D cycles between display of track with asterisk, no display and drums muted, display MIDI note letters for track).
The MIDI out can then be connected to another machine with a Passport MIDI card running a mockingboard tone generator program for the MIDI IN data.
